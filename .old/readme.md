# Configrepo
Made for storing config files.

## Precaution
This repo's zsh config is not completely compatible (if thats the right word) at the moment. (yeah all you did to make this repo is just blindly copypaste files anyway..)
If you want to proceed installing the config using the _install_ file, then i'd recommend you to edit that file and remove the .zshrc and .zcompsadapwdpowkq or something idk. (i forgor)

## Credits
I'd certainly put some credits here but i do not have time for that for now. maybe later, sorry ¯\ _ (ツ) _ /¯




Oh right, btw...
