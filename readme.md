# archaei's dotfiles

this dotfiles was from my old setup and i'm warning you right now this is not intended for public use for the configs and dirs placement i use here is all messy and quite possibly depreceted (in other words, totally unreal; as in useless). nothing good here i use repository to save configs for future use / as reference point and backups.
