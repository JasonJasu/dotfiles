# archaei's dotfiles

This dotfiles was used in my old arch setup (no pun intended), and I'm warning you right now this is not intended for public use for the stuff and dirs placement i use here is all fucked up and messy (unreal). Actually nothing crazy happened here I just happened to save this configs to maybe use it as reference point and backups in the future (i still cant forget the moment i lost the og custom color palette and build i made back in 2020). Using X11 display server, dwm for the window manager, and jonaburg's picom fork. I guess i better list the stuffs then :

## The 'Stuffs'
- [Jonaburg's picom](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom) (compositor)
- [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) (window manager) w/custom patch
- alacritty (terminal)
- feh (wallpaper loader)
- [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) (the swiss pocket knife, the legend itself) 
- Nerd Fonts
